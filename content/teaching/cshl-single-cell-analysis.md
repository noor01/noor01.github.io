## Course Overview

I have served as an invited lecturer and instructor for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's prestigious Single Cell Analysis course across four years (2019, 2022, 2023, 2024). This intensive course provides advanced training in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics computational analysis to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty from institutions across the United States.

## Role & Responsibilities

- **Invited Lecturer**: Delivered lectures on advanced concepts in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics
- **Hands-on Instructor**: Led practical computational workshops and data analysis sessions
- **Curriculum Development**: Contributed to course materials and computational modules
- **Student Mentoring**: Provided individual guidance to participants on their research projects

## Course Content

### Topics Covered
- **Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis**: Data preprocessing, quality control, normalization, and dimensionality reduction
- **Spatial Transcriptomics Methods**: Analysis of spatial gene expression patterns and cellular organization
- **Computational Frameworks**: Implementation of analysis pipelines and interpretation of results
- **Advanced Techniques**: Integration of multi-modal data and trajectory analysis
- **Best Practices**: Reproducible research methods and data visualization

### Learning Modules
The course is structured into four main bioinformatics modules:
1. **Programming Fundamentals**: Python programming for bioinformatics
2. **RNA-seq Analysis**: Single-cell RNA sequencing data processing
3. **Multi-omics Integration**: Combining different data modalities
4. **Spatial Transcriptomics**: Spatial data analysis and visualization

## Course Materials

All course materials, including Jupyter notebooks, slide presentations, and datasets, are available through the [YeoLab CSHL 2022 repository](https://github.com/YeoLab/cshl_2022). The materials cover:

- Interactive coding notebooks with step-by-step analysis workflows
- Comprehensive slide presentations on theoretical concepts
- Curated datasets for hands-on practice
- Code examples and best practices

## Impact & Reach

- **Participants**: Graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty from universities nationwide
- **Duration**: Intensive multi-day workshop format
- **Recurring Role**: Invited back multiple years (2019, 2022, 2023, 2024)
- **Methodology**: Combination of lectures, hands-on workshops, and individual mentoring

## Course Format

The course combines theoretical lectures with extensive hands-on computational workshops, allowing participants to gain practical experience with real-world datasets and analysis challenges. The interactive format ensures that attendees can apply learned concepts immediately and receive personalized guidance.

## Recognition

Being invited to teach at CSHL's Single Cell Analysis course multiple times reflects the quality and impact of the instruction. CSHL courses are internationally recognized for their rigorous scientific content and prestigious faculty.
