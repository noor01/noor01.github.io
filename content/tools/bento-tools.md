## Overview

Bento is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed for performing subcellular analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. As part of the Scverse ecosystem, it provides researchers with powerful tools to analyze RNA localization patterns within cells and understand cellular organization at the subcellular level.

## Key Features

- **Subcellular Compartment Analysis**: Identify and analyze distinct subcellular regions
- **RNA Localization Mapping**: Track and visualize RNA distribution patterns
- **Spatial Pattern Detection**: Discover spatial organization principles
- **Integration with Scverse**: Seamless compatibility with the single-cell analysis ecosystem
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive tutorials and API documentation
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and community support

## Installation

```bash
pip install bento-tools
```

## Key Applications

- Analysis of spatial transcriptomics data (10x Visium, MERFISH, etc.)
- Subcellular compartment identification and characterization
- RNA localization pattern analysis
- Spatial gene expression profiling
- Cell-type specific spatial analysis

## Documentation & Support

- **Documentation**: [bento-tools.readthedocs.io](https://bento-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **Community Support**: Available through Scverse Zulip chat (#bento stream)
- **Issues & Contributions**: GitHub repository for bug reports and feature requests

## Statistics

- **GitHub Stars**: 80+
- **Downloads**: Growing user base in spatial transcriptomics community
- **Contributors**: 5+ active contributors
