## Abstract

This work presents a novel approach that combines pooled CRISPR screens with imaging on microraft arrays to systematically identify stress granule-regulatory factors. The method provides new insights into RNA biology and cellular stress responses.

## Key Contributions

- Novel integration of CRISPR screens with microraft imaging
- Systematic identification of stress granule-regulatory factors
- Innovative approach to RNA biology research
- High-throughput analysis of cellular stress responses

## Impact

This work has been published in Nature Methods and provides important insights into stress granule biology and RNA regulation.
