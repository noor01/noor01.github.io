## Abstract

This work presents a microfluidic droplet-based platform for single-cell genome sequencing at ultra-high-throughput. The method uses microfluidic droplet barcoding to enable scalable analysis of cellular heterogeneity at the genomic level.

## Key Contributions

- Ultra-high-throughput single-cell genome sequencing
- Microfluidic droplet barcoding platform
- Scalable analysis of cellular heterogeneity
- Novel approach to single-cell genomics

## Impact

This work has significantly advanced single-cell genomics methodologies and has been published in Nature Biotechnology, a leading journal in biotechnology.
