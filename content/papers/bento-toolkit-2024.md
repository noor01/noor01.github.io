## Abstract

Bento is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed for subcellular analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. This tool enables researchers to analyze RNA localization patterns within cells, providing insights into cellular organization and function.

## Key Features

- Subcellular compartment identification
- RNA localization analysis
- Spatial pattern detection
- Comprehensive visualization tools
- Integration with existing spatial transcriptomics workflows

## Impact

This work provides essential tools for the spatial transcriptomics community and has been published in Genome Biology, a leading journal in computational biology.
